This Python module contains a variety of classes and extension modules for
conducting assorted statistical tests. I mostly created it because I did not
want to learn how to use SPSS or R, but also wanted to lay some groundwork for
distributing tools to properly conduct tests performed incorrectly in many
commercial statistical software packages such as SPSS. It is still a work in
progress, but I will add more useful documentation over time.

Note that this module requires that you have installed the scipy.stats module.
